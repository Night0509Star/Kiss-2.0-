        <p>
          Paul Stanley, born Stanley Bert Eisen on January 20, 1952, in New York, is an American musician best known for founding the rock band Kiss, where he was the frontman, rhythm guitarist, and co-lead vocalist. 
          He created his stage persona "The Starchild", one of the most famous characters among Kiss fans. 
          Stanley was one of the main songwriters in Kiss and contributed to many of the band's most popular songs. 
          He was in the band from its inception in 1973 until its breakup in 2023. Stanley has also had his own career and released his first album in 1978 and followed up with Live to Win in 2006. 
          After Kiss's breakup, he continued with music, including with Paul Stanley's Soul Station, which interprets classic soul and R&B songs. 
          He has also continued his career as a painter and has had exhibitions of his works.(Wikipedia,2025, Paul Stanley).

        <p>
          Gene Simmons, whose real name is Chaim Witz, was born on August 25, 1949, in Haifa, Israel. 
          He is an Israeli-American musician best known as the bassist and co-founder of the rock band Kiss.
          ​​He took his stage name after rockabilly musician Jumpin’ Gene Simmons and later became known as "The Demon".
          Simmons is perhaps best known for his long tongue, which he often sticks out when performing, a gesture that has become one of his signatures. 
          When performing with Kiss, he has always looked like a demon and has often featured things like fire breathing and spitting fake blood to deepen and convey his dark and theatrical image. 
          He co-founded Kiss in 1973 and played with the band until their final show in 2023. (Wikipedia,2025, Gene Simmons).

       Ace Frehley, born Paul Daniel Frehley on April 27, 1951, in New York City, was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter.
        He was best known as the original guitarist and co-founder of the rock band Kiss. ​​Frehley's stage persona.

        After reuniting with Kiss in 1996 and touring with them until 2002 after their "Farewell Tour" Frehley left the band again. His latest solo album, 10,000 Volts, was released in 2024.

         Peter Criss, born George Peter John Criscuola, is best known as the original drummer and co-founder of the rock band Kiss.
          ​​Criss was instrumental in the band's success with the ballad "Beth," which he both wrote and sang. During his time in the band,
          he also developed a rough, jazz-influenced drumming style. Tensions and conflicts within the band led to Criss leaving Kiss in 1980.
          He returned in the late 1990s for the acclaimed reunion tour and then played with the band until 2004. 
          Kiss, with its theatrical style and mix of rock and spectacle, has left a strong mark on rock history, 
          where Criss' contribution as both a musician and a visual icon is central. (Wikipedia,2025,Peter Criss).

    <summary>reason to live - 1987</summary>
        <p>
          "Reason to Live" is a power ballad by American rock band Kiss, released as a single on November 12, 1987. 
          The song is from the album Crazy Nights and was written by the band's frontman, Paul Stanley, together with well-known songwriter Desmond Child. 
          The album was produced by Ron Nevison, who previously worked with, among others, Led Zeppelin and Heart.The music video, directed by Marty Callner, 
          shows the band performing the song in front of a large, illuminated stage, alternating with scenes of a young woman, played by model Eloise Broady, dealing with a stormy relationship with Stanley. 
          In the video, she is seen, among other things, throwing a wine bottle and burning a photo, as well as setting fire to a Porsche 928, a car Stanley had received as a gift from Gene Simmons. 
          The scenes were filmed at the Orange Pavilion in San Bernardino and in Hollywood, California. Despite extensive play on MTV, "Reason to Live" only reached number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 34 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks in the United States. 
          The single peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song became one of Kiss' most prominent ballads and a hallmark of their late 1980s style. (Wikipedia, 2025, Reason to Live)

    <summary>Uh all night</summary>
         <p>
            Uh! All Night from KISS's album Asylum (1985) is a steamy and catchy song that is often noticed when listening to the album and therefore you feel lighthearted about the steamy and lustful feeling that captures one's best attention for a second single release after the slightly more noticed song Tears Are Falling. 
            The music video for the song, directed by David Mallet, is a noble variation on an "80s video" and contains choreographed dance numbers with older women and new young girls dancing, but has been criticized over the years for objectifying women by portraying them as "ballbreakers" on the screens and embodying stereotypical female characters. However, it still happens that the band's musical performances, and not least the guitar solo, receive a lot of praise. 
            The video is definitely not unnoticed, because something handlady radiates all the way to the right of the image and it is perhaps even too prominent to be perceived as sensitive by some
            In summary, Uh! All Night is a steamy song that is hard to forget, a beautiful object of KISS's playful and melodic side in the mid-1980s. (Mikeladano,2022, Uh all night).

    <summary>Lick me up</summary>
        <p>
            “Lick It Up" is a song by American rock band KISS, released as a single on September 18, 1983, from the band's eleventh studio album of the same name. 
            The song was written by Paul Stanley and Vinnie Vincent and was a new beginning for the band, as it was their first single without makeup since 1979. Musically, the song is energetic and moves within the genres of glam metal, pop metal and hard rock, and the drive of the song reflected the band's new, unadorned image. 
            The recording was made in the summer of 1983 at New York's Right Track Studios and the song was produced by Michael James Jackson together with Stanley and Simmons.
             The song only peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, but became a top 40 hit in the United Kingdom and some other countries. The music video, the band's first without makeup, premiered on MTV the same day the single was released, thus becoming a visual breakthrough for the band. 
             Lick It Up has since become one of the songs that KISS has played the most live. (Wikipedia.org, 2025, Lick it up)

    <summary>Jungle</summary>
         <p>
           "Jungle" is a single by American rock band KISS, released in 1997 as part of their studio album Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions. 
           The song was written by Paul Stanley, Bruce Kulick, and Curtis Cuomo, and is the longest song the band has ever recorded for a studio album, with a duration of 6 minutes and 49 seconds. 
           The song has been described musically as having a "semi-funky grunge-lite riff" reminiscent of Collective Soul's hit "Shine".
           Despite little promotion, "Jungle" reached number 8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the United States. It also received the Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for Song of the Year in 1997. 
           KISS never actually performed the song live, but it was later interpreted by Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer as part of the Eric Singer Project and is also featured on the DVD Live at the Marquee.(Wikipedia.org. 2025,Jungle)

    <summary>You make me rock hard</summary>
         <p>
           "(You Make Me) Rock Hard" is a single by American rock band KISS, released in December 1988. The song was included on their compilation album Smashes, Thrashes & Hits. 
           The song was written by Paul Stanley, Desmond Child, and Diane Warren, and was one of two new songs on the album, the other being "Let's Put the X in Sex".
           The song was recorded in July 1988 by Paul Stanley working alone at Right Track Studios in New York City. The song was characterized by a danceable beat and the use of keyboards, which led some fans to wonder what direction the band was taking musically.
           "(You Make Me) Rock Hard" received attention for its music video, which ranked at number 8 on Classic Rock's list of the best hard rock videos.
           KISS never deviated from the "(You Make Me) Rock Hard" song when they played live, but Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer later reinterpreted it as part of the Eric Singer Project, and it was included on their DVD Live at the Marquee.(Wikipedia.org. 2025, You make me rock hard)
